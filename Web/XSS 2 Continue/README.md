Hint: How to become admin by using the stolen admin cookie?
<br>According to the hint, we need to use the admin cookie to view the secret only avaiable for admin
<br>This is easy! Since I have the "Cookie Editor" extension, we can paste the admin session we stole earlier into the "session" cookie

<br>After saving the cookie, reload the page and we can see a section named "Secret"

<br>Viewing the secret section we get the flag!
