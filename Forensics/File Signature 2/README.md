So we know that the "File Signature" challenge, there's a zip file so let's try unzipping it 
<br>The zip file is locked with a password so you can try using john the ripper to crack the password but I successfully cracked the password in just one try XD
<br>Basically since the flag format is SKR{} i thought that the password could be "skr" and I didn't thought it would actually work but it did lol
<br>Inside the zip file there's a secret_msg file just use the command ``cat secret_msg`` or open it in notepad and it'll give the flag!
